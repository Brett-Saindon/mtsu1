A website I designed and developed during my time at MTSU.

Rathic is an online photo and art gallery where users can view and submit photographs and artwork. 
List of pages:
•	Home (index.html)
•	Art (art.html)
•	Photography (photography.html)
•	About (about.html)
•	Contact (contact.html)
•	FAQ (faq.html)

Some added features include: two carousels, one for photos and one for art; interactive photo and art galleries on the 
Photography and Art pages (image swap); contact page with tabs, one of which has a modal that opens the contact form.
